## Homework 5 - Brezuleanu


I used weight and biases to hypertune my parameters: Link to wandb: 
https://wandb.ai/brezuleanu-mihai-alexandru/homework5/workspace?workspace=user-brezuleanu-mihai-alexandru
I logged all the hyperparameters and results in the tensorboard and I uploaded a folder with the logs.
I run at least 3 different configuration for every optimizer that is listed in the assigment and the result are in the weight and biases and tensorboard logs.

The best result was with the sgd optimizer with sam, batch_size = 256, learning_rate = 0.1.
The validation accuracy was in this case 0.4859(close to 0.5).

Expected points: 6
